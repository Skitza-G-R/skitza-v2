## 🚨 HARD GATE — BMAD IS MANDATORY

**The user is a non-technical solo founder. Claude is the entire engineering org.**
**Every product-change request MUST go through BMAD before any code, subagent dispatch, or design answer.**

### The rule

When the user sends a request:

1. Is it purely informational? ("explain X", "show me Y", "what's the status") → answer directly, no BMAD.
2. Is it "skip BMAD" / "just do X" / "quick" (when user explicitly overrides)? → proceed, but note the risk.
3. Is it ANYTHING ELSE involving the Skitza codebase? → **MUST invoke the `bmad` skill as the first action of the turn.**

### First-response pattern (non-negotiable for category #3)

```
🔧 Running BMAD · <Quick|Standard|Large> track · Phase 1: Analyst

Before I start, a few quick questions:
  1. <plain-English question>
  2. <plain-English question>
  3. <plain-English question>

(Say "skip BMAD" to jump straight to coding. Not recommended — the 90-second
 investment here prevents the 60-minute rebuild later.)
```

**No code. No subagent. No file reads yet.** Just the announcement + questions.

### Track selection heuristics (Claude decides, user doesn't need to)

- **Quick**: typo / copy / one-line fix → skip to Dev
- **Standard** (default for 80% of requests): 2-10 files, new component, UI change, simple backend tweak
- **Large**: new surface / schema change / new tRPC procedures / multi-sub-tab / anything touching payments

### Non-developer mode (ALWAYS active with this user)

- ❌ Never ask "tRPC mutation or server action?" / "producerProcedure or publicProcedure?" / "optimistic updates?"
- ✅ Translate to "does this happen instantly or in the background?" / "who can do this?" / "should the UI update instantly?"
- ❌ Never dump file paths or type signatures on the user
- ✅ Summarize in plain English after each story: *"✅ Quick Note modal opens from QuickActions, saves automatically, closes on save. Preview: <url>"*
- ❌ Never require user approval on the Architect doc
- ✅ Do require user approval on PRD deltas and on open product trade-offs

### If you're about to violate the gate

If you find yourself about to write code, dispatch a subagent, or answer a design question WITHOUT having invoked BMAD this turn, **STOP**. Rewind. Announce the phase. Ask the Analyst questions.

The `UserPromptSubmit` hook at `.claude/hooks/bmad-enforce.sh` also injects a reminder into every turn. If you still skip it, the user is authorized to say "where's the BMAD announcement?" and you redo the turn from the top.

## Product at a glance

**Skitza** is a SaaS for independent music producers. It replaces the
Calendly + Samply + Notion + DocuSign + Stripe + WhatsApp stack with one
product. Two audiences, one codebase:

- **Producers** — authenticated app at `/dashboard` (4 screens: Today / Projects / Music / Setup)
- **Artists** — authenticated app at `/artist` (4 tabs: Home / Music / Book / Store), plus public flows at `/p/<slug>` and `/p/<slug>/book`

Full product vision: see `docs/product/PRD.md`.

---

## Documentation rules (READ FIRST)

Skitza uses a structured docs system. If you're about to create or edit an `.md` file, follow these rules.

### 📍 Start every session here

1. **This file (CLAUDE.md)** — HOW we work (conventions, mistakes, commands). Auto-loaded.
2. **[`docs/session_recap.md`](docs/session_recap.md)** — **LIVE handoff state.** Read FIRST thing. Tells you what we just did, current branch, what's next. Updated at every checkpoint.
3. **[`docs/INDEX.md`](docs/INDEX.md)** — the master map. Where everything lives.
4. **[`docs/product/PRD.md`](docs/product/PRD.md)** — WHAT we build (product spec). 27 sections, 70+ locked decisions.

### 📂 Where new `.md` files go

| Type | Location | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Active implementation plan | `docs/plans/active/` | current sprint work |
| Shipped/merged plan | `docs/plans/archive/` | move here when PR merges |
| Design doc for a plan | Same folder as the plan | `foo-design.md` next to `foo.md` |
| Per-story detail | `docs/plans/stories/` | S01/S02/S03 files |
| Product decision log | `docs/decisions/` | Q&A behind a PRD change |
| QA review | `docs/qa/` | dated phase reviews |

### 🚫 Do NOT

- Create loose `.md` files at the repo root (PRD and CLAUDE are the only ones).
- Copy product rules from PRD.md into this file — link to the PRD section instead.
- Copy conventions from this file into PRD.md — link here instead.
- Leave shipped plans in `docs/plans/` — move them to `archive/` when their PR merges.

### 🧹 Keeping it clean

Run **`/docs-audit`** (slash command) any time to get a drift report.

---

## Session handoff protocol (READ — applies to you, Claude)

You **must** keep [`docs/session_recap.md`](docs/session_recap.md) current. It is the single file that makes context resets painless.

### Update it at these triggers

- After opening or merging a PR
- After a major product decision or tech pivot
- After a BMAD phase completes (Analyst → PM → Architect → SM → Dev → Ship)
- Before dispatching a long sequence of subagents
- When conversation feels long/dense (heuristic: 5+ tool calls this turn, or many exchanges without a save-point) — a context reset may be near
- When the user types **`/checkpoint`** (the slash command formalizes this)

### How to update

- **Overwrite, never append.** The file is a snapshot, not a log. `git log docs/session_recap.md` preserves history.
- Keep it under ~80 lines.
- Preserve the section structure (Last checkpoint / What we just finished / Current state / What's next / Context that matters / How to resume / Files to glance at / Update discipline).
- Timestamp the "Last checkpoint" line with today's date.
- Commit with `docs(recap): checkpoint — <one-line>`. Push if not on main.

### Why

Before this protocol, every context reset cost 5-10 minutes of re-discovery. With it, a fresh session reads one file and knows the state. Do not skip the checkpoints.

---

## Tech stack

Canonical list: **[`docs/product/PRD.md` §27 (Appendix: tech-stack commitments)](docs/product/PRD.md)**.

This file used to duplicate that table, which created drift risk. If a stack decision changes, update PRD §27 only.

## Database & migrations — READ THIS

### The journal is broken

`packages/db/drizzle/meta/_journal.json` only tracks through migration **0018**.
Migrations **0019-0028** exist as `.sql` files but are NOT in the journal.
Consequence: `drizzle-kit migrate` reads the journal, sees nothing new past 0018,
and skips everything. Do NOT rely on `drizzle-kit migrate` until the journal is fixed.

**Canonical migration workflow until the journal is fixed:**

```bash
# Apply migrations directly via neon HTTP client
/skitza-migrate
# (or manually: run packages/db/apply-migrations.mjs with DATABASE_URL set)
```

The `/skitza-migrate` command reads each `drizzle/*.sql` file, strips BEGIN/COMMIT,
and executes statements directly via `sql([stmt])` tagged-template trick (neon HTTP's
only raw-SQL path). All migrations are `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` or similar idempotent
forms, so re-running is safe.

### Mistake log — migrations

- **2026-04-20**: Dashboard crashed in production with `column "default_session_min" of relation "producers" does not exist` on preview. Migrations 0025-0028 had never applied because of the journal drift. Fix: direct SQL execution via neon client.

### When writing new migrations

1. Change `packages/db/src/schema.ts`
2. `pnpm -F @skitza/db db:generate` to produce the next numbered `drizzle/NNNN_<name>.sql` file
3. **Verify the SQL is `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` where possible** (idempotent)
4. Use `BEGIN; ... COMMIT;` blocks so the migration is atomic
5. Sanity-check: existing rows must not break under the migration (use `NOT NULL DEFAULT` for add-only)
6. Apply via `/skitza-migrate` — do NOT touch `_journal.json` until we fix it properly

---

## Testing conventions

### Placement

- Unit tests live next to the file being tested as `foo.test.ts` or in `__tests__/foo.test.ts`
- tRPC router tests in `apps/web/src/server/trpc/routers/__tests__/`
- DB integration tests in `packages/db/src/__tests__/` (require `DATABASE_URL_TEST`)

### Mock-DB pattern (tRPC tests)

Use **marker objects** to branch by table. Example from `artist-home.test.ts`:

```ts
const projectsMarker = { __table: "projects" };
const bookingsMarker = { __table: "bookings" };

const dbMock = {
  select: () => ({
    from: (table: unknown) => {
      if (table === projectsMarker) { /* ... */ }
      if (table === bookingsMarker) { /* ... */ }
      throw new Error(`unexpected select().from(${String(table)})`);
    },
  }),
};

vi.mock("@skitza/db", () => ({
  createDb: () => dbMock,
  projects: projectsMarker,
  bookings: bookingsMarker,
  eq: (col: unknown, val: unknown) => ({ eq: [col, val] }),
  and: (...args: unknown[]) => ({ and: args }),
}));
```

### Auth-scoping assertions

Walk the WHERE predicate tree with the `findPredicate` helper to assert that
queries are scoped to the caller's tenant (producerId / clerkUserId / emailHash).
Example:

```ts
const where = lastWhereArgs as unknown;
expect(findPredicate(where, producersMarker, "id", ctx.producerId)).toBe(true);
```

This catches silent regressions that drop tenant-scoping predicates.

### Common test helpers

- `emailHashFor(email)` — trim + lowercase + sha256 (used in both prod code + tests)
- `findPredicate` — walks `and()`-nested WHERE clauses

---

## tRPC conventions

### Procedure bases

- `publicProcedure` — no auth, rate-limited
- `producerProcedure` — requires Clerk session + producer row; `ctx.producerId` available
- `artistProcedure` — requires Clerk session; `ctx.userId` + `ctx.emailHash`; does NOT require a producer row

### Router file layout

```ts
export const fooRouter = router({
  list: producerProcedure.query(async ({ ctx }) => { /* ... */ }),
  create: producerProcedure.input(FooInput).mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => { /* ... */ }),
});
```

### Input validation

Always use Zod. Nested `z.object({ ... }).strict()` for tight validation.

### Aggregation queries

When assembling a single-round-trip payload (e.g. `producer.today`, `artist.home`),
use `Promise.all` across the fan-out queries. Each leg scopes by tenant in its `WHERE`.
See `producer.ts` `today` procedure for the canonical 9-way fan-out pattern.

### Error handling

Throw `TRPCError` with specific codes:
- `UNAUTHORIZED` — not signed in
- `FORBIDDEN` — signed in but not authorized for this resource
- `NOT_FOUND` — resource doesn't exist (used for ALL auth-failed paths on magic links, to avoid enumeration)
- `CONFLICT` — uniqueness violation (e.g. slug taken)
- `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` — rate limit

---

## UI / styling conventions

### CSS variables — no hex codes

Colors, radii, shadows all go through CSS custom properties. Examples:

```tsx
className="bg-[rgb(var(--bg-elevated))] text-[rgb(var(--fg-primary))] border-[rgb(var(--border-subtle))] rounded-[var(--radius-md)]"
```

**Never** `bg-blue-500`, `text-red-600`, `#f3f4f6`. These break theming and RTL.

### Key tokens

- `--bg-base`, `--bg-elevated`, `--bg-overlay`
- `--fg-primary`, `--fg-secondary`, `--fg-muted`, `--fg-inverse`, `--fg-warning`, `--fg-danger`
- `--brand-primary`, `--brand-accent`
- `--border-subtle`, `--border-strong`
- `--radius-sm`, `--radius-md`, `--radius-lg`

Full palette lives in `apps/web/src/app/globals.css`.

### Alpha in Tailwind arbitrary values

Use the `/0.08` suffix pattern. **Do NOT nest `var()` with fallback inside `rgb()` with alpha** — the parser fails silently.

```tsx
// ✅ Works
className="bg-[rgb(var(--fg-danger)/0.08)]"

// ❌ Doesn't work — nested var() eats the `/` before alpha parses
className="bg-[rgb(var(--fg-danger,var(--brand-primary))/0.08)]"
```

### Animation primitives (CSS-only, no framer-motion)

All in `globals.css`:
- `.sk-lift` — subtle hover lift (-1px + shadow)
- `.sk-pop` / `.sk-pop-center` — dropdown/modal fade+scale-in
- `.sk-cta-shine` — diagonal shimmer on CTA hover
- `.sk-pulse-hover` — breathing glow on hover
- `.reveal-up` — fade + slide-up on mount
- `.pulse-glow` — persistent brand-colored pulse

Every primitive MUST have a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` gate that
neutralizes it. There's a test (`apps/web/src/app/__tests__/motion-primitives.test.ts`)
that fails CI if a new primitive skips the reduce gate.

### Responsive patterns

- **Mobile-first**. Every new layout must work at 360px before 1280px.
- **Touch targets ≥ 44×44** on mobile. Use `.sk-tap` utility.
- **iOS safe-area** respected via `.sk-safe-top`, `.sk-safe-bottom`, `.sk-safe-x`.
- **Momentum scrolling** on horizontal rails via `.sk-scroll-x`.
- **`:focus-visible`** (not `:focus`) for keyboard focus rings, so mouse clicks don't trigger them.

### ARIA patterns

- Tabs: `id="tab-<key>"` + `aria-controls="panel-<key>"` on the tab; `id="panel-<key>"` + `aria-labelledby="tab-<key>"` on the panel. Both IDs MUST match.
- Nav active: `aria-current="page"`, NOT `aria-pressed` (that's for toggles).
- Dropdowns/modals: `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal="true"` + Esc to close.

## i18n — scope is the authenticated app only

### Rules

1. **Landing page + public routes (`/`, `/p/<slug>`, `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/m/<token>`) are ENGLISH ONLY, LTR ONLY.** No `t()` calls, no `NextIntlClientProvider`, no locale cookie effects.
2. The `<html>` element at the root layout is ALWAYS `lang="en" dir="ltr"`. Do NOT put conditional `dir` on `<html>` — it breaks hydration with next-themes + Clerk UserButton.
3. RTL applies per-route-group via `<AppI18nProvider>` which wraps authenticated app layouts only: `(app)`, `(artist)`, `(artist-welcome)`, `(onboarding)`.
4. Default locale: `en` for everyone. No IP-based auto-detection.
5. Hebrew is opt-in via the language chip in the sidebar footer (writes `NEXT_LOCALE=he` cookie).
6. Translation files: `apps/web/messages/{en,he,ar}.json`. ar is stubbed empty.

### When adding a new user-facing string inside the app

- Add the key to both `en.json` and `he.json` (Hebrew can be machine-quality for now).
- Use `useTranslations('namespace')` in client components or `getTranslations('namespace')` in server components.
- Never inline English strings that need to be translated later — they'll leak past the translation wave.

### Mistake log — i18n

- **2026-04-20**: Put i18n at root layout → `<html dir="rtl">` conflicted with next-themes + Clerk UserButton → hydration mismatch → dashboard crashed. Fix: pin root to LTR always, wrap only authenticated groups with `<AppI18nProvider>`.
- **2026-04-20**: Used IP-based locale detection → Israeli users got Hebrew by default with no way to opt out on the landing page (which was also affected). Fix: killed IP detection, default English, explicit opt-in via chip.

## Product decisions — where they live

All 70+ locked product decisions live in **[`docs/product/PRD.md`](docs/product/PRD.md)** (27 sections).

The Q&A journey that produced those decisions is in **[`docs/decisions/360-prd-answers.md`](docs/decisions/360-prd-answers.md)** (explains the *why* behind each PRD choice).

Hard non-goals (what NOT to build) live in **[PRD §25](docs/product/PRD.md)**.

**Rule:** if a product rule changes, update PRD.md only. Do not copy rules into this file — it creates drift. CLAUDE.md describes HOW we work (conventions, commands, mistakes); PRD.md describes WHAT we build.

---

## Commits & PRs

### Style

- Prefix: `feat(scope):`, `fix(scope):`, `refactor(scope):`, `docs(scope):`, `ci:`, `test:`
- Imperative mood: "add" not "added", "fix" not "fixed"
- Body explains WHY + what trade-offs were made
- Co-Authored-By line: `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`

### Discipline

- **Verify before commit**: `pnpm -F web typecheck && pnpm -F web lint && pnpm -F web test` must all pass.
- **Frequent small commits**. Each commit should be a logical unit that could be reverted independently.
- **NEVER `git commit --amend`** — always new commits, even for small fixes. Amending rewrites history and makes bisecting harder. The user explicitly prefers this.
- **NEVER `git push --force`** to shared branches.
- **Don't skip hooks** (no `--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`).

## Workflow when starting a new feature — use BMAD

The canonical workflow is **BMAD** (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development),
adapted for Skitza's existing structure.

- **Skill:** `.claude/skills/bmad/SKILL.md`
- **User guide:** `docs/bmad-workflow.md`
- **Templates:** `.claude/skills/bmad/templates/` (brief.md, epic.md, story.md)

**3 tracks** — pick by scope:

- **Quick**: 1-file fix / copy tweak → skip straight to Dev (no brief, no PRD delta)
- **Standard**: 2-10 files → Brief → PRD delta → Architecture lite → Dev → QA
- **Large**: new surface / schema / multi-sub-tab → Brief → PRD section → standalone Architecture doc → Epic + Stories → Dev (per story, fresh subagent) → QA

**5 roles** (each with its own artifact):

1. **Analyst** — 3 questions, 1-page brief at `docs/plans/<date>-<feature>-brief.md`
2. **PM** — PRD delta in `docs/product/PRD.md`, committed as `docs(prd):` **BEFORE** any code lands
3. **Architect** — technical design in plan doc or standalone; cites `packages/db/src/schema.ts` + exact file paths; specifies `/skitza-migrate` for DB changes
4. **Scrum Master** (Large only) — self-contained story files at `docs/plans/stories/<feature>-NN-<title>.md`
5. **Dev + QA** — Dev via `.claude/agents/skitza-tdd-implementer.md`; QA via spec-compliance subagent + `.claude/agents/skitza-ux-critic.md`

**Always:**
- Read `CLAUDE.md` + `docs/product/PRD.md` before PM phase
- Fresh subagent per Dev story (prevents context rot)
- Commit PRD delta BEFORE any code
- `/skitza-verify` between stories + before push
- New commits (never `--amend`)
- Update the mistake log below when a surprise surfaces

**User magic phrases:**
- `Quick BMAD: <thing>` — trivial work, skip to Dev
- `Standard BMAD: <thing>` — default, full phase flow
- `Large BMAD: <thing>` — big scope, multiple subagent dispatches
- `BMAD me: <thing>` — Claude picks the track
- `Switch to <role>` / `Re-dispatch QA` / `Rewind to <phase>` — mid-feature interjections

See `docs/bmad-workflow.md` §Magic phrases for the full list.

## Running mistake log

Append here any time Claude does something wrong. Date it. Don't remove entries —
they're tribal knowledge.

- **2026-04-17**: Plan said invoice status was `{open, past_due}` but the DB enum is `{draft, sent, uncollectible, paid, refunded, void}`. The plan was fabricated; always verify enums against `packages/db/src/schema.ts`.
- **2026-04-18**: Used `--amend` to fix a commit message → lost a line in the body. User explicitly prefers NEW commits for every fix.
- **2026-04-19**: Forgot to update ARIA IDs when renaming `AudioTab` → `MusicSubTab`. The outer tab rendered `id="tab-music"` + `aria-controls="panel-music"` but MusicSubTab kept `id="panel-audio"` + `aria-labelledby="tab-audio"`. Always update ARIA IDs when renaming tabs.
- **2026-04-19**: Bloated `Project` prop interface copied from AudioTab into MusicSubTab — 19 fields when only `project.id` was read. When extracting a component, strip the prop interface to actual usage.
- **2026-04-19**: Left `.success` toast variant on informational stubs — green tint for "this isn't wired yet" is wrong affective cue. Use `info` variant for non-success confirmations.
- **2026-04-19**: `rgb(var(--fg-danger,var(--brand-primary))/0.08)` — nested var() with alpha doesn't parse in Tailwind arbitrary values. Strip the fallback, use plain `rgb(var(--fg-danger)/0.08)`.
- **2026-04-20**: Scope creep on Setup page — built cross-link cards that pointed to deleted pages. User wanted full management UI inline on every tab.
- **2026-04-20**: Misunderstood the "link" flow 3 times. User wants `skitza.app/p/<slug>` to push new visitors into artist-side sign-up, not the producer marketing page. (PRD entry pending.)
- **2026-04-20**: Put next-intl provider at root layout → crashed on Hebrew due to `<html dir>` conflict with next-themes + Clerk. Fix: pin root html to en/ltr, scope i18n to authenticated route groups only.
- **2026-04-20**: `drizzle-kit migrate` skipped 0019-0028 because `_journal.json` was stale. Production DB was missing 8 columns → dashboard crashed. Fix: direct SQL via neon client (`/skitza-migrate`).
- **2026-04-20**: `sql.query(stmt)` and `sql.unsafe(stmt)` don't exist in neon HTTP client. The ONLY way to execute raw SQL with no placeholders is the TemplateStringsArray trick: `sql(Object.assign([stmt], { raw: [stmt] }))`.
- **2026-04-22**: Went straight to code for audit Fix #2 (try/catch wrapper in `publicProfile.forJoin`) — no failing test first, no RED phase, no TDD. User called it out with *"did you tdd?"*. Remediation: wrote the resilience test after the fact, temporarily reverted the try/catch to prove the test goes RED against the original bug (it did — same `TRPCError: relation "producer_external_links" does not exist` as prod), then restored the fix and confirmed GREEN across the full 584-test suite. **Rule going forward: applying a migration (infra) is not testable and correctly skips TDD. Adding a code branch / error-handler / defensive wrapper IS production behavior and MUST have a failing test first.** Without the RED phase, a test can pass vacuously and pin nothing.
- **2026-04-23**: Claimed all 5 overnight PRs were "verified clean" in the first post-run recap, but never actually ran the final gates on the remote — just trusted my local check from the moment I opened each PR. Gili later asked for a pre-merge audit; doing it properly surfaced that (a) GitHub Actions CI was RED on every PR (turned out to be a billing block, not a code issue — but I hadn't noticed), and (b) `docs/audit-report.md` would cascade-conflict on every merge after the first. Fix was cheap (spot-check ~10 lines per rebase), but the lesson is: **"tests passed locally when I wrote them" is not the same as "main+branch merges clean today."** When multiple PRs share files, re-run the gate on every branch tip post-merge of its predecessors, and specifically check `gh pr checks <n>` before declaring anything green.
- **2026-04-23**: Wrote docs commits locally on `main` (recap + pre-merge audit) before the feature PRs merged. After the feature PRs landed on origin, my local commits conflicted with their own merged-back-via-PR version of themselves. Had to `git reset --hard origin/main` and lose the local history because the same content had already shipped via PR #37. **Rule: when a doc is already queued in a PR, don't also commit it locally on main "just in case."** Either commit on a branch from the start, or don't commit until the PR lands.
- **2026-04-23 (post-observability)**: First real bug caught by the Sentry + Vercel-logs wiring: `/dashboard/projects/[id]` crashed with "Attempted to call isProjectSubTabId() from the server but isProjectSubTabId is on the client." — the page imported a plain function from a `"use client"` module. **Rule: NEVER export non-component (lowercase) functions/consts from a `"use client"` file if ANY server component might import them.** Extract pure types + predicates into a plain `.ts` module that has no `"use client"` directive and no browser APIs — both the client component and the server page can import from there safely. Pattern for catching this class of bug in tests: a one-liner that reads the file's source and asserts the first non-empty line isn't `"use client"` — pins the invariant so a future hook-add doesn't silently break the server page. See audit-report Task 18.
- **2026-04-23 (R2 CORS)**: Audio upload broke in prod with "Failed to fetch" even though server-side presigned-URL minting returned 200s in Vercel logs. The R2 bucket had NO CORS policy, so the browser's OPTIONS preflight to the presigned R2 URL returned 403 and the PUT never fired. **Rule for any browser-direct-to-storage pattern (R2, S3, GCS, Azure Blob): CORS config is a pre-requisite, not an afterthought.** For Skitza: policy lives in `apps/web/src/server/storage/r2-cors.ts`, applied via `apps/web/scripts/apply-r2-cors.mjs` (one-shot, idempotent — PutBucketCorsCommand replaces prior policy). Must `ExposeHeaders: ["ETag"]` for multipart — without it the browser hides ETag from JS even after request succeeds, and `completeMultipart` can't reconstruct the part manifest. Verification: `curl -X OPTIONS <bucket-url> -H "Origin: https://skitza.app" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT"` should return 200 + `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://skitza.app`. See audit-report Task 19.
- **2026-04-26 (R2 CORS — recurrence)**: Same symptom as 2026-04-23. User reported every audio upload returning "Failed to fetch (skitza-audio.<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com)" across every project. Curl preflight returned `HTTP 403` with explicit body `<Message>CORS not configured for this bucket</Message>` — confirming the policy was dropped from the live bucket again, despite the in-code policy being correct. Re-applying via `apps/web/scripts/apply-r2-cors.mjs` (with `vercel env pull` providing prod creds) restored uploads. **Root cause unknown** — could be a bucket recreation, a Cloudflare reset, or a free-tier quirk. **What changed: added `apps/web/scripts/check-r2-cors.mjs`** — a no-creds OPTIONS-preflight diagnostic that exits non-zero if either bucket is missing CORS. Run it any time, or wire it into a periodic monitor (CI cron / uptime probe) so the next regression is caught in minutes instead of via a producer hitting "Failed to fetch" mid-upload. **Rule going forward: when an infra config drops twice, ship the detection alongside the fix — don't just re-apply and hope.** The diagnostic script is cheap; the next user-visible breakage is not.
- **2026-04-26 (landing-restore CSS scoping)**: When porting source HTML's `<style>` block into a wrapper-scoped stylesheet, every `body.foo` selector (chained class on body) MUST become `.wrapper.foo` (chained class on the wrapper) — NOT `.wrapper .foo` (descendant combinator). The S1 agent ported source `body.page-loaded .hero-word { ... }` as `.landing-root .page-loaded .hero-word { ... }` — the stray space turned chained class into descendant combinator. Result: the rule required `.page-loaded` to be both a *descendant* of `.landing-root` AND an *ancestor* of `.hero-word` simultaneously — impossible since `.hero` is a direct child of `.landing-root`. Hero subhead, CTAs, mockup cards, and word-fade spans all stayed at opacity 0; the founder saw a blank brown void below the hero on the Vercel preview (PR #50). The decomposed-port (S1-S4) shipped with this bug; the verbatim-port pivot (`879d578`) didn't fix it; the targeted CSS scoping fix (`c1f454f`) finally did. **Rule for future CSS ports: when scoping body-level state classes onto a wrapper, preserve chained-vs-descendant semantics literally — chained classes (no space between selectors) MUST stay chained.** Easy way to grep for the regression: `grep -n '\.wrapper \.\(foo\|bar\)' your.css` after a port — any space between two `.classes` is a red flag for state classes.

## Post-merge ops playbook (2026-04-23)

When ops work follows a merge — migrations, env vars, third-party integrations — these patterns were proven in the post-overnight run.

### Apply migrations to prod (journal is broken past 0028, use direct runner)

```bash
set -a && . apps/web/.env.local && set +a
node packages/db/apply-migrations.mjs
```

Every migration in the repo is `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` / `CREATE … IF NOT EXISTS` — idempotent, safe to re-run. Output ends with `All migrations applied successfully.` Do NOT `drizzle-kit migrate` — it reads `_journal.json` and skips anything past 0018.

### Never accept credentials via chat

Even "public" keys (`NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` ends up in the browser JS bundle anyway). Same channel could later carry a Stripe secret. Keep the habit universal: copy straight from source (Sentry/PostHog/Clerk/Stripe dashboard) to destination (Vercel env vars). Never through a middleman — not chat, not email, not Slack.

### Verify a third-party integration is live without leaking a key

Example for PostHog (hits the `/ingest` proxy rewrite, then forwards to posthog.com):

```bash
curl -s "https://skitza.app/ingest/decide?v=3" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"token":"dummy"}'
```

Expect: `The provided API key is invalid or has expired.` That response proves (1) the rewrite routes correctly, (2) the upstream service is receiving requests and validating keys. No real secret required for the smoke test.

### Resolve `docs/audit-report.md` cascading conflicts

Every fix PR appends a row + fix-log to `docs/audit-report.md`. Merging PRs sequentially conflicts every PR after the first. Pattern:

1. `git checkout <branch> && git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main`
2. Edit the conflict block — **keep both halves** of the status table (the already-merged rows + the incoming row)
3. Stale `(Task X, PR pending)` references → replace with the actual `(PR #N)` reference as you go
4. `git add docs/audit-report.md && git rebase --continue`
5. Re-verify gates (`pnpm -F web typecheck && pnpm -F web lint && pnpm -F web test`)
6. `git push --force-with-lease` + `gh pr merge <n> --squash --delete-branch`

### SaaS setup sequence (for future Clerk / Stripe / Resend wiring)

1. Gili signs up in the vendor dashboard (only they can; never Claude)
2. Gili captures the credentials in a local notes file / password manager
3. Gili pastes each env var into Vercel (Production + Preview + Development — all 3)
4. Vercel auto-redeploys (~2 min) when env vars change
5. Claude runs a no-key smoke test (like the `/ingest/decide` pattern above) to confirm routing
6. Gili does one real in-browser verification (send a test pageview, throw a test error, etc.)
